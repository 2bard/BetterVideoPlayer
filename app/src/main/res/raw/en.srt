0
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,838
Kids, I'm gonna tell you

1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,772
An incredible story;

2
00:00:06,774 --> 00:00:08,440
The story of how

3
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:10,109
I met your mother.

4
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:11,610
Are we being punished
for something?

5
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:12,678
No.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,446
Yeah, is this gonna
take a while?

7
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:18,283
Yes. 25 years ago,
before I was dad,

8
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:23,789
I had this whole other life.

9
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:26,392
<i>It was way back in 2005.</i>

10
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:29,328
<i>I was 27, just starting
to make it as an architect</i>

11
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,629
<i>And living in new york
with marshall,</i>

12
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:32,331
<i>My best friend from college.</i>

13
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,832
<i>My life was good.</i>

14
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:36,835
<i>And then uncle marshall went
and screwed the whole thing up.</i>

15
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:39,304
Will you marry me?

16
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:41,006
Yes.

17
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:42,875
Perfect!
And then you're engaged.

18
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:44,843
You pop the champagne.
You drink a toast.

19
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,712
You have sex
on the kitchen floor.

20
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:47,880
Don't have sex
on our kitchen floor.

21
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:48,881
Got it.

22
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:50,816
Thanks for helping me
plan this out, ted.

23
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:51,884
Dude, are you kidding?

24
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:54,820
I've been there for all the big moments
of you and lilly:

25
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:56,655
Night you met,

26
00:00:56,657 --> 00:01:00,426
Your first date,
other first things.

27
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:01,360
Yeah, sorry.

28
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:03,328
We thought you were asleep.

29
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,763
It's physics, marshall.

30
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:07,933
If the bottom bunk moves,
the top bunk moves, too.

31
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:10,536
My god.

32
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:12,871
You're getting engaged tonight.

33
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:14,940
Yeah.

34
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:15,841
What are you doin' tonight?

35
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:18,710
<i>What was I doing?</i>

36
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:21,080
<i>Here uncle marshall was taking
the biggest step of his life.</i>

37
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:24,183
<i>I'm calling up
your uncle barney.</i>

38
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:26,218
Hey, so you know
how I've always had a thing

39
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,352
For half-asian girls?

40
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:33,392
Well, now I've got
a new favorite-- lebanese girls.

41
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:35,727
Lebanese girls
are the new half-asians.

42
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,429
Hey, you want
to do somethin' tonight?

43
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,799
Okay, meet me at the bar
in 15 minutes. And suit up!

44
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,136
Hey.

45
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:46,905
Where's your suit?
Just once,

46
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:48,740
When I say suit up,
I wish you'd put on a suit.

47
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:50,075
I did that one time.

48
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:52,811
It was a blazer!

49
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,213
You know,

50
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:57,082
Ever since college
it's been, marshall
and lilly and me.

51
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:59,218
Now, it's gonna be
marshall and lilly...

52
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,586
And me.

53
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:02,121
They'll get married,
start a family.

54
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:04,957
Before long,
I'm that weird,
middle-aged bachelor

55
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,859
Their kids call
uncle ted.

56
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:09,928
I see what this is about.

57
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,898
Have you forgotten
what I said to you
the night we met?

58
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,803
Ted, I'm gonna teach
you how to live.

59
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,339
Barney.
We met at the urinal.

60
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:21,807
Oh, right. Right.

61
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,642
Lesson one:
Lose the goatee.

62
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:24,977
It doesn't go
with your suit.

63
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,311
I'm not wearing a suit.

64
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,946
Lesson two: Get a suit.

65
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:30,315
Suits are cool.
Exhibit "a."

66
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,117
Lesson three:
Don't even think

67
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:35,320
About getting married
till you're 30.

68
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,822
30. Right.
You're right.

69
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,758
I guess it's just,
your best friend
gets engaged,

70
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,926
You start thinking
about that stuff.

71
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:43,462
I thought I was
your best friend.

72
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:45,931
Ted, say
I'm your best friend.

73
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:48,033
You're my best
friend, barney.

74
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:49,434
Good. Then,
as your best friend,

75
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:50,936
I suggest we play
a little game

76
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:52,371
I like to call
"have you met ted?"

77
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:54,173
Wait. No, no, no.
We're not playing
"have you met ted?"

78
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:55,474
Hi, have you met ted?

79
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:56,875
Hi,

80
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:58,677
I'm ted.

81
00:02:58,679 --> 00:02:59,678
Yasmine.

82
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,946
That's a very pretty name.

83
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:03,081
Thanks. It's lebanese.

84
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,186
Hey.

85
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:09,154
I'm exhausted.

86
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:11,690
It was finger-painting day
at school,

87
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:15,060
And a five year-old boy got
to second base with me.

88
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,197
Wow! You're cooking?

89
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,065
Yes, I am.

90
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:23,235
Aw...

91
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:24,536
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

92
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,973
After last time, you looked
really creepy without eyebrows.

93
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:30,976
I think you'll
find I'm full of
surprises tonight.

94
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:32,644
So, there's more surprises?
Likewhat?

95
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:35,214
Marshall was in his second year
of law school,

96
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:38,150
<i>So he was pretty good
at thinking on his feet.</i>

97
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:40,085
Boogedyboo!

98
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,721
And that's all of 'em.

99
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,957
I'm gonna go... Cook.

100
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,093
I'm so happy for marshall,
I really am.

101
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:49,861
I just couldn't imagine
settling down right now.

102
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:51,430
So, do you think
you'll ever get married?

103
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:55,400
Well, maybe eventually...
Some fall day,

104
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,568
Possibly in central park.

105
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:00,239
Simple ceremony.
We'll write our own vows.

106
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:02,207
Band, no dj.
People will dance!

107
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,575
I'm not gonna worry
about it!

108
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:07,079
Damn it, why did marshall
have to get engaged?

109
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:08,280
Yeah, nothing hotter

110
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:11,083
Than a guy planning out
his own imaginary wedding, huh?

111
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,185
Actually,
I think it's cute.

112
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:14,920
Well, you're clearly drunk.

113
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,321
One more for the lady!

114
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,758
Oh, hey,
look what I got.

115
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,498
Oh, honey! Champagne.

116
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:34,206
No. You are too old to be scared
to open a bottle of champagne.

117
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,140
I'm not scared.

118
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,208
Then open it.

119
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,276
Fine.

120
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:39,878
Please open it?

121
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,714
You are unbelievable,
marshall.

122
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:45,050
<i>There are two big questions
a man has to ask in life.</i>

123
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:47,052
<i>One, you plan out for months.</i>

124
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:49,421
<i>The other just slips out when
you're half drunk at some bar.</i>

125
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:50,822
Will you marry me?

126
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,591
You wanna go out
sometime?

127
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,626
Of course, you idiot!

128
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:59,164
I'm sorry,
carl's my boyfriend.

129
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:03,802
'sup, carl?

130
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:10,008
I promised ted
we wouldn't do that.

131
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,312
Did you know
there's a pop tart
under your fridge?

132
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:15,280
No, but dibs.

133
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:18,250
Where's that champagne?

134
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:20,519
I wanna drink a toast
with my fiancÃ©e.

135
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,254
Oh!

136
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,958
I don't know why
I was so scared of this.

137
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,627
It's pretty easy, right?

138
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,128
<i>Oh!</i>

139
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,497
Why am I freaking out
all of a sudden?

140
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,133
This is crazy.
I'm not ready
to settle down.

141
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:38,036
How does carl land
a lebanese girl?

142
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,204
The plan has always been

143
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,173
Don't even think about it
until you're 30.

144
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,941
Exactly. The guy doesn't
even own a suit.

145
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:45,310
Plus, marshall's found
the love of his life.

146
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:47,612
Even if I was ready,
which I'm not...

147
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,114
But if I was,
it's, like,

148
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:53,452
"okay, I'm ready. Where is she?"

149
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:59,091
<i>And there she was.</i>

150
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,232
<i>It was like something
from an old movie,</i>

151
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:08,567
<i>Where the sailor sees the girl</i>

152
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:09,968
Across the crowded dance floor,

153
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,905
<i>Turns to his buddy and says,
"see that girl?</i>

154
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,374
<i>I'm gonna marry her someday."</i>

155
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:18,310
Hey, barney,
see that girl?

156
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:21,513
Oh, yeah. You just know
she likes it dirty.

157
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,081
Go say hi.

158
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,050
I can't just go say hi.

159
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,218
I need a plan.

160
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,586
I'm gonna wait
until she goes
to the bathroom,

161
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,554
Then I'll strategically place
myself by the jukebox...

162
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,723
Hi, have you met ted?

163
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,193
Hi.

164
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,095
Let me guess...

165
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:38,663
Ted.

166
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:43,735
Sorry, lilly.
I'm so sorry.

167
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:44,936
Take us to the hospital.

168
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:45,871
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

169
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,105
Did you hit her?

170
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:53,211
This guy can barely
even spank me in
bed for fun.

171
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:56,081
He's all like, "oh, honey.
Did that hurt?"

172
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,682
And, I'm like,
"come on!

173
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,418
Let me have it,
you pansy!"

174
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,420
Wow, a complete stranger.

175
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,522
No, no, no, no! It's okay.
Go on.

176
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:06,858
So, these,
uh, spankings...

177
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,395
You in pajamas
or au naturel?

178
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:11,296
So, what do you do?

179
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,298
I'm a reporter
for metro news one.

180
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,299
Oh.

181
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:15,567
Well, kind of a reporter.

182
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,469
I do those dumb
little fluff pieces

183
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:18,770
At the end of the news.

184
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,940
You know, like, um...
Monkey who can play
the ukulele.

185
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,743
I'm hoping to get
some bigger stories soon.

186
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:27,813
Bigger, like, uh...
Gorilla with an upright bass?

187
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:29,414
Sorry.
You're really pretty.

188
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:35,754
Oh, your friends
don't seem to happy.

189
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:37,422
Yeah, see, the one
in the middle just
got dumped

190
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:38,890
By her boyfriend.

191
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,459
So, tonight, every guy
is "the enemy."

192
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:42,327
You know if it'll make
your friend feel better,

193
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,995
You could throw a drink
in my face. I don't mind.

194
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:45,764
She would love that!

195
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:49,134
And it does look
fun in the movies.

196
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,936
Hey, you wanna have dinner
with me Saturday night?

197
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:55,006
Oh, I can't.
I'm going to orlando
for a week on Friday.

198
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,775
Some guy's attempting to make
the world's biggest pancake.

199
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,243
Guess who's covering it?

200
00:07:58,245 --> 00:07:59,644
That's gonna take a week?

201
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,279
Yeah, he's gonna
eat it, too.

202
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,647
It's another record.

203
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,949
Hey! What's takin' so long?

204
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:06,017
Uh, I know this
is a long shot,

205
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,986
But how 'bout tomorrow night?

206
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:11,490
Yeah. What the hell?

207
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:18,997
Jerk!

208
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,365
<i>That was fun.</i>

209
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:23,535
De... Wait for it...

210
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:24,970
Nied!

211
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,605
Denied!

212
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,173
We're goin' out
tomorrow night.

213
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,175
I thought we were playin'
laser tag tomorrow night.

214
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:33,845
Yeah, I was never gonna
go play laser tag.

215
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,017
<i>The next night,
I took her out</i>

216
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,185
<i>To this little bistro
in brooklyn.</i>

217
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,319
Wow!

218
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:44,055
That is one badass
blue french horn.

219
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,524
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

220
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,792
Sort of looks
like a smurf penis.

221
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:51,496
<i>Son, a piece of advice:
When you go on a first date,</i>

222
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:54,366
<i>You really don't wanna say
"smurf penis."</i>

223
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:57,636
<i>Girls don't
ordinarily like that.</i>

224
00:08:57,638 --> 00:09:00,372
<i>But this was no ordinary girl.</i>

225
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:05,877
Lilly?

226
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,548
How long have
you been sitting there?

227
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,284
Stupid eye patch.

228
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,253
Mom, dad,

229
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:18,256
I have found
the future mrs. Ted mosby.

230
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:19,925
Marshall, how have I always

231
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:20,759
Described my perfect woman?

232
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,427
Now, let's see...

233
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:23,662
She likes dogs?

234
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,330
I've got five dogs.

235
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:26,231
She drinks scotch?

236
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,532
I love a scotch that's old

237
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,367
Enough to order its own scotch.

238
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,269
<i>Can quote obscure lines
from ghostbusters?</i>

239
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:36,441
Ray! When someone asks you
if you're a god, you say "yes!"

240
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,410
And I'm saving
the best for last.

241
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:41,046
Do you want these?
I hate olives.

242
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:43,448
She hates olives! Awesome!

243
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,183
The olive theory.

244
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:48,086
The olive theory
is based on my friends
marshall and lilly.

245
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,421
He hates olives,
she loves them.

246
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:52,057
In a weird way,
that's what makes
them such a great couple.

247
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:53,458
Perfect balance.

248
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,961
You know, I've had
a jar of olives

249
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:58,630
Just sitting
in my fridge forever.

250
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,233
I could take 'em
off your hands.

251
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,903
They're all yours.

252
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,471
Oh, it is on!

253
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:08,406
It is on

254
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:10,108
<i>Till the break of dawn.</i>

255
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,611
But wait.

256
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,546
It's only the break of 10:30.
What happened?

257
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,382
I gotta get one
of those blue
french horns

258
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:18,416
For over my fireplace.

259
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,585
It's gotta be blue.
It's gotta be french.

260
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:21,653
No green clarinet?

261
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:23,254
Nope.
Come on.
No purple tuba?

262
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,557
It's a smurf penis
or no dice.

263
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:28,393
There you are!

264
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:29,394
We got a jumper.

265
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,162
Some crazy guy
on the manhattan bridge.

266
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:32,464
Come on. You're coverin' it!

267
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:35,934
Um... All right.
I'll be right there.

268
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:39,437
I'm sorry.

269
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,072
I had a really
great time tonight.

270
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,641
Yeah.

271
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:43,942
<i>So?!</i>

272
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:45,310
Did you kiss her?

273
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,445
No. The moment wasn't right.

274
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:49,748
Look, this woman
could actually be
my future wife.

275
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,449
I want our first kiss
to be amazing.

276
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:54,419
Aw, ted, that is so sweet.

277
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:57,689
So you chickened out
like a little bitch.

278
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:00,291
What? I did not chicken out.

279
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:01,426
You know what?

280
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:03,595
I don't need to take
first kiss advice

281
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:05,163
From some pirate
who hasn't been single

282
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,598
Since the first week of college.

283
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,300
Anyone who's single
would tell you
the same thing,

284
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,536
Even the dumbest
single person alive.

285
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:14,272
And if you don't believe me,
call him.

286
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:16,841
Hey, loser.

287
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,777
How's not playing laser tag?

288
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,311
Because playing
laser tag is awesome!

289
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,047
Oh, I killed you,
conner!

290
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:23,815
Don't make me
get your mom!

291
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,517
Hey, listen.
I need your opinion
on something.

292
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,651
Okay, meet me
at the bar in
15 minutes.

293
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:28,520
And suit up!

294
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,356
So, these guys
think I chickened out.

295
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,857
What do you think?

296
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:37,662
I can't believe you're
still not wearing a suit.

297
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:39,497
She didn't even
give me the signal.

298
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:40,632
What, is she gonna, she gonna

299
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:42,567
Bat her eyes at you
in morse code?

300
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:45,070
"ted...

301
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:46,037
Kiss me."

302
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,505
No! You just kiss her!

303
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:50,208
Not if you don't
get the signal.

304
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,546
Did marshall
give me the signal?

305
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:55,580
No!

306
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:57,582
I didn't. I swear.

307
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,018
But, see,
at least tonight,

308
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,720
I get to sleep knowing
marshall and me,

309
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:02,721
Never gonna happen.

310
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:03,755
You should have
kissed her.

311
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:05,690
Oh, I should have kissed her.

312
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:08,059
Well, maybe in a week when
she gets back from orlando.

313
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,528
A week? That's like
a year in hot girl time.

314
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,063
She'll forget all about you.

315
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:15,066
Mark my words-- you will
never see that one again.

316
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,768
There she is.

317
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,670
Ooh! She's cute.

318
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:20,004
Hey, carl,
turn it up.

319
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,272
...Persuaded him to reconsider.

320
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:24,075
At which point, the man
came down off the ledge,

321
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,512
Giving this bizarre story
a happy ending.

322
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:28,680
Reporting from metro one news...
Huh.

323
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:30,081
Guy didn't jump.

324
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,517
I'm gonna go kiss her.

325
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,185
Right now.

326
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:35,553
Look, dude.
It's midnight.

327
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:36,855
As your future lawyer,

328
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:39,424
I'm gonna advise you
that's freakin' crazy.

329
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,925
I never do anything crazy.

330
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,460
I'm always
waiting for the moment,

331
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:43,728
Planning the moment.

332
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,196
Well, she's leaving tomorrow.

333
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,298
This may be
the only moment I'm gonna get.

334
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,933
I gotta do what
that guy couldn't.

335
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,735
I gotta take the leap!

336
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,771
Okay, not a perfect metaphor,

337
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:55,140
'cause for me it's fall
in love and get married,

338
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:56,608
And for him it's... Death.

339
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,711
Actually, that
is a perfect metaphor.

340
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:02,213
By the way, did I
congratulate you two?

341
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,649
I'm doing this.

342
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:05,717
Let's go.

343
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:06,918
Word up.

344
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,386
We're coming
with you.

345
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,421
Barney?

346
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:12,423
All right,

347
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,459
But under one condition.

348
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,728
Look at you, you
beautiful bastard.

349
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,962
You suited up!

350
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,898
This is totally
going in my blog!

351
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,599
Stop the car.

352
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,368
Uh, pull over
right here.

353
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,137
I gotta do something.

354
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,673
Excuse me. Pardon me.

355
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,441
Just a sec'.
Enjoy your coffee.

356
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:31,442
Hey!

357
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:32,510
Hey!

358
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,646
Go! Go! Go!

359
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:40,084
Everybody
brings flowers.

360
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:50,328
Okay.
Moment of truth.

361
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,697
Wish me luck.

362
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:55,533
Ted's gonna get it on
with a tv reporter.

363
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:58,403
"this just in." okay.

364
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,674
Kiss her, ted!

365
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:03,541
Kiss her good!

366
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,844
Kiss the crap
outta that girl!

367
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,011
Marshall, remember this night.

368
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,147
When you're the best man
at our wedding

369
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:11,683
And you give a speech,
you're gonna tell this story.

370
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:15,954
Why does he get
to be the best man?

371
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,856
I'm your
best friend!

372
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,557
<i>As I walked up to that door,</i>

373
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,559
<i>A million thoughts
raced through my mind.</i>

374
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:24,729
<i>Unfortunately, one particular
thought did not.</i>

375
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,197
I've got five dogs.

376
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:30,368
Not good. Not good.
Not good. Not good. Not good.

377
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,302
No!

378
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:32,370
Get back in there!

379
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,538
You're wearing
a suit!

380
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:38,176
Ted?

381
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,445
Hi.

382
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,649
I was just, uh...

383
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:49,787
Come on up.

384
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:52,824
He's in.

385
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:55,526
So...

386
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:58,496
Ranjit, you must have done
it with a lebanese girl?

387
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,765
Okay, that's
my barney limit.

388
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,701
I'm gonna see if that bodega
has a bathroom.

389
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:06,671
Actually,
I'm from bangladesh.

390
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:08,740
The women hot there?

391
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:11,342
Here's a picture
of my wife.

392
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,281
A simple "no" would
have sufficed.

393
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:19,250
She's lovely.

394
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,952
So, ted,

395
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:22,420
What brings you back
to brooklyn

396
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,689
At 1:00 in the morning
in a suit?

397
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:28,026
I was just hoping to...

398
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:31,863
Get those olives...
That you said I could have.

399
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:35,199
Would you like those olives
with some gin and vermouth?

400
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,869
Are you trying to get me drunk?

401
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,207
For starters.

402
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:52,083
So, marshall,
this olive theory,

403
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,751
Based on you and lilly?

404
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:54,819
Yeah.

405
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:55,920
You hate olives.

406
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:57,789
Lilly loves 'em.
You can't stand 'em.

407
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,557
Yeah. Hate olives.

408
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,459
Two weeks ago, spanish bar
on 79th street,

409
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,462
Dish of olives, you had some--
what up?

410
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:10,401
You have to swear that this
does not leave this cab.

411
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:11,769
I swear.

412
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,237
I swear.

413
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,341
On our first date,

414
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:17,809
I ordered a greek salad.

415
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,844
Lilly asked if she
could have my olives.

416
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:22,747
I said, "sure. I hate olives."

417
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,248
But, you like olives.

418
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,784
Well, I was 18, okay?
I was a virgin.

419
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:30,421
Been waitin' my whole life for
a pretty girl to want my olives.

420
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:33,791
Marshall, I'm gonna give you
an early wedding present.

421
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:36,728
Don't get married.

422
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:44,002
âª baby, since I met you, oh...

423
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:46,671
I think I like
your olive theory.

424
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,841
I think I like
your new french horn.

425
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:53,444
I think I like your nose.

426
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,680
I think I'm
in love with you.

427
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:56,848
What?!
What?!
What?!

428
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,882
What?
What?

429
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:58,983
What?

430
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,218
Come on, man,
you said

431
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,185
Your stomach's been
hurting, right?

432
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,387
You know what that is.

433
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:03,654
Hunger.

434
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:04,989
You're hungry for experience.

435
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:06,457
Hungry for something new.

436
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:09,560
Hungry for olives.

437
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,829
But you're too scared
to do anything about it.

438
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:14,132
Yeah, I'm scared,
okay?

439
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,234
But, when I think
of spending

440
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,802
The rest of my life
with lilly--

441
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:21,806
Committing, forever,
no other women--

442
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:24,876
Doesn't scare me at all.

443
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,878
I'm marrying that girl.

444
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,748
Lilly.

445
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,850
Lilly, I like olives.

446
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:35,119
We'll make it work.

447
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:40,658
Aw...

448
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,332
So, orlando.

449
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:50,268
You gonna
hit disneyworld?

450
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:52,937
You love me?!

451
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,740
I-I-I can't believe
I said that.

452
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:56,841
Why did I say that?

453
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:58,109
Who says that?

454
00:17:58,111 --> 00:17:59,944
I should just go.

455
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:01,112
Hold on.

456
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:02,613
Wait a minute.

457
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,451
Promised you these.

458
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,119
Olives.
Yeah.

459
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:09,787
Thanks. I love you.

460
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,956
What is wrong
with me?

461
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:14,892
Why are we still
sitting here?

462
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,694
Let's go. We can still
make last call.

463
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:17,728
What do you say, lil?

464
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,798
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum?

465
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,469
'cause you're a pirate.

466
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:26,537
Okay, eye patch, gone.

467
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,407
And we can't just
abandon ted.

468
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:32,143
If it doesn't go well up there,
he's gonna need some support.

469
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:33,911
It's been,
like, 20 minutes.

470
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:35,713
You think they're doin' it?

471
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,648
You think they're doin' it
in front of the dogs?

472
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,583
<i>Doggy style.</i>

473
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:39,784
Hey, there was
a girl in college,

474
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,085
She had this golden
retriever...

475
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:43,154
Okay, we can go to the bar.
Just stop talking.

476
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,189
Hit it, ranjit.

477
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,063
So, when you tell
this story to your friends,

478
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:53,898
Could you avoid
the word "psycho?"

479
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,068
I'd prefer... "eccentric."

480
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,470
Good night... Psycho.

481
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,009
Great.

482
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:06,911
Um, how do I get to the f train?

483
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:09,647
Oh, um, two blocks

484
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,415
That way and take a right.

485
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,154
You know what?

486
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,789
I'm done being single.

487
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,825
I'm not good at it.

488
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,093
Look, obviously,

489
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:24,929
You can't tell a woman
you just met you love her.

490
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:28,166
But...
It sucks that you can't.

491
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,434
I'll tell you something, though.

492
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:33,671
If a woman-- not you, just some
hypothetical woman--

493
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,107
Were to bear with me
through all this,

494
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:39,043
I think I'd make
a damn good husband.

495
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:41,345
Because, that's
the stuff I'd be good at,

496
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:44,448
Stuff like making her laugh
and being a good father.

497
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,785
And walking her five
hypothetical dogs.

498
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,988
Being a good kisser.

499
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,858
Everyone thinks
they're a good kisser.

500
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,660
Oh, I've got references.

501
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:58,229
Good night, ted.

502
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,837
And I'm a good handshaker.

503
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,106
That's a pretty
great handshake.

504
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,378
And that was it.

505
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,315
I'll probably
never see her again.

506
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:19,517
What?

507
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,085
That was the signal.

508
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,087
That long,
lingering handshake?

509
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:24,755
You should have kissed her.

510
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,325
There's no such thing
as "the signal."

511
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:29,694
But, yeah,
that was the signal.

512
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:31,929
Signal.

513
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:34,031
Ah, carl,
thank you.

514
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,833
Something
I gotta do.

515
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:38,069
By the way,

516
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,737
You should have kissed her.

517
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,073
Carl!
You guys weren't there.

518
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,110
I am so turned
on right now.

519
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:48,512
Guys, trust me.

520
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:49,513
I've seen the signal.

521
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,949
That was not the signal.

522
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,918
Yeah, ted, we're
not on you anymore.

523
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,120
To my fiancÃ©e.

524
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:58,189
To the future.

525
00:20:58,191 --> 00:21:00,124
To one hell
of a night!

526
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:06,130
That was not the signal.

527
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:08,766
<i>I asked her
about it years later.</i>

528
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,034
And, yeah, that was the signal.

529
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:11,535
<i>I could have kissed her.</i>

530
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:13,271
<i>But that's the funny
thing about destiny.</i>

531
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:15,773
<i>It happens
whether you plan it or not.</i>

532
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,075
<i>I mean, I never thought
I'd see that girl again,</i>

533
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:20,811
<i>But it turns out I was just
too close to the puzzle</i>

534
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,713
<i>To see the picture
that was forming.</i>

535
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:24,315
<i>Because, that, kids,</i>

536
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:27,585
Is the true story of how
I met your aunt robin.

537
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:29,920
Aunt robin?

538
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:32,323
I thought this was
how you met mom!

539
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:33,424
Will you relax?

540
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:35,059
I'm getting to it.

541
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:37,128
Like I said, it's a long story.
